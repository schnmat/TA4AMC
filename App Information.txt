Local data stored:
 - An array of local theatres is gathered whenever the location is set. So that api requests that require
   a theatre's id can be made without first getting the theatre's id from a separate api call.
 - A location object is saved with the users' city, state, zip code, and utc offset. The zip code isn't
   used, and the city/state is only used to be able to ask what theatres are in the user's location
   without having to specify the location again. The utc offset is used to convert time from the server
   to the user's local time zone.
 - A favorite theatre object can be set by the user. When the user sets their location the first theatre
   in the list of theatres found in their location is automatically set as their favorite. It's used to
   be able to request showtimes and other movie information without having to specify which theatre to
   look at in the request.
 - A last action object is saved every time a request is made. It holds the last response given so that
   the user can request Alexa to repeat the last action.
