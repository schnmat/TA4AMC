# Theatre Assistante for AMC

This skill allows the user to get information about movies and showtimes that are playing at local AMC theatres. And to save a preferred theatre so that future requests don't have to specify the theatre for each request.

You can save the preferred theatre you visit so that you don't need to specify the theatre name in future requests. Save your preferred theatre by saying "Set my favorite theatre to" followed by the name of the theatre. Or you can set you location by city and state, or by zip code, to have the skill search for theatres in your hometown and set one as the default.

When requesting information, you can still ask for information from another theatre without changing the saved theatre by adding the theatre name to your request. For example: "What time is {movie} playing at {theatre}".

You can get a list of movies playing at that theatre by simply asking "what's playing right now?", or get showtimes for a movie by asking "when is {movie} playing?".

You can also look up showtimes for a specific day (i.e. tomorrow, friday, or saturday) by adding it to the end of your question (e.g. "When is {movie} playing tomorrow?"). By default, showtime requests will search for showtimes on the current day.
